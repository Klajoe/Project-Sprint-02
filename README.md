In the Project-Sprint2, the following enhancements have been made:

1. Addition of a new HTML file named "comment.html": This section allows the user to enter their username and the desired date of a specific movie, where they can leave comments about the movie. These comments can be read by other users.

2. Modification of the date picker: The color of the date picker was changed to red as it was difficult to select a date when the color matched the background. Although it does not perfectly match the theme, it still looks visually appealing.

3. Implementation of movie selection: When the user clicks on the "movie" section, a list of selectable movie names appears below. The user is required to choose one of these names. The purpose of this implementation is to eliminate invalid movie names.
